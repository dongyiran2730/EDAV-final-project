A few other columns each has lower than 10 missing values. The missing values only occupy a little percentage of the total data. By examining the missing value patter from graph above, we discover that over 90% rows are complete and the most frequent missing pattern is only missing the data of “X3_point_percentage”. We observed that there is 0 in columns, such as X3_point_percentage and free_throw_percentage, so na does not represent the player does not score 3 points or not not earn free throw point. It is not recorded due to some unknown facts or lost on the website. We have checked these data in the original website:https://www.basketball-reference.com/, where it is not recorded as well. We also notice that the missing value in one column is correalted to the missing value in another column. Otherwise, the missing pattern should be a single missing value each row. We will investigate that in the following graph. There is another two players with many missing data."

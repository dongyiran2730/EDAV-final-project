# Conclusion

Our exploration revealed that while NBA draft pick numbers often indicate a player's potential, especially in the top 10 picks, they do not always correlate with superior performance in all metrics. Teams like the Seattle SuperSonics, Orlando Magic, Golden State Warriors, and Cleveland Cavaliers have been successful in drafting high-achieving players. Players from prominent colleges like Oregon and Kentucky frequently excel in the NBA. Physical attributes also play a role, with larger players excelling in rebounds and smaller players in assists. The typical NBA player profile ranges around 210 cm and 120 kg, or closer to 190 cm and 80 kg. Additionally, non-American players have adapted well to the NBA, showing no significant issues in transitioning.

However, our study faced limitations, primarily in the reliance on publicly accessible datasets that only have data from 1989 and on. Moving forward, our future research directions include expanding our dataset to encompass player data before 1989, incorporating more comprehensive achievement data, and delving deeper into factors like coach history, team health/injury management, and even high school backgrounds.

From this research, we learned the importance of selective data analysis. While preparing a vast array of player statistics, we realized the challenge in analyzing them comprehensively. This led to the understanding that focusing on key features and discerning their relevance is crucial in making more meaningful and accurate assessments in sports analytics. This lesson will guide our future approaches in data-driven sports analysis, ensuring more focused and impactful research outcomes.
